        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
        <br>
        It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language. 
        <br>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
        <br>        
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
        <br>
        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        <br>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        <br>        
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
        <br>
        The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
        <br>
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
