        The Geography Markup Language (GML) is the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to express geographical features.
        <br>
        GML serves as a modeling language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange format for geographic transactions on the Internet.
        <br>
        Key to GML's utility is its ability to integrate all forms of geographic information, including not only conventional "vector" or discrete objects, but coverages (see also GMLJP2) and sensor data.
